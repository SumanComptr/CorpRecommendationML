Corp Recommendation Machine Learning Model using K Nearest Neighbor recommendation algorithm 

Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to take important decision about the farming strategy. 
Here, we build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

The basic procedures implemented to achieve the goals of this research are:

1. Data collection
2. Data cleaning and wrangling
3. Data Analysis and Visualization
4. Feature encoding
5. Modeling
6. Model accuracy evaluation
7. Measure loss value

a. Programming Language - Python
b. Libreary/Packages - Numpy,Pandas,MatPlotlib,Seaborn,Scikit-learn
c. Statistical Algorithm - K Nearest Neighbor
